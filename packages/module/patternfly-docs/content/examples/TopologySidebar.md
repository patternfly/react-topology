# Introduction

A **side bar** is a menu that is displayed in a side drawer within a Topology view.

## Using a side bar

To add a sidebar to a Topology view:

1. Wrap your `VisualizationProvider` with the `<TopologyView>` component, which accepts `sideBar` as a property.

1. Pass the `<TopologySideBar>` component to the `sideBar` property. `<TopologySideBar>` should accept the following properties:
    - **`show`:** Logic to show the sidebar.
      - For example, you may display the side bar when a node is selected.
    - **`onClose`:** Handles the behavior that should be triggered when users close the side bar.
      - For example, you may deselect the current selection.

### Example

```ts file='./TopologySidebarDemo.tsx'
```
