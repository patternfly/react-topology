# Introduction

A **context menu** displays a list of actions or links related to a graph element. Nodes, edges, and the graph itself can have context menus, which are shown when you select the menu toggle or right-click on a graph element. Context menus are useful to allow users to trigger a process or navigate to a new location.

## Using context menus

To add a context menu to a Topology element, you can simply extend `WithContextMenuProps` and use the `withContextMenu` utility when the context menu component is returned in the `componentFactory`. For example, `withContextMenu(() => contextMenu)(MyCustomNode)`. The component should accept 2 parameters: 

- **`onContextMenu`:** The function to call upon node selection. Typically the outer container for the component would call `onContextMenu` when clicked.
- **`contextMenuOpen`:** Indicates if the menu is currently open and applies styling to the respective component.

If you are using `DefaultNode`, these properties can be passed along and will be handled appropriately.


### Example 

```ts file='./TopologyContextMenuDemo.tsx'
```
